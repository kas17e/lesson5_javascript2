### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The onClick method allows you to set an action to a button in order to make it function.
2. The code document.getElementById("example").value = ""; removes the text from the calculation working to clear the form.
3. The getElementById() is used as a means to give the calculation a place to be on the webpage.
